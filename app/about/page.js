      <p>
        CineRate started years ago, back when my brother and I were working as security guards on
        movie sets. At the time, I was living in his laundry room — money was tight, but we found
        small ways to have fun. Between shifts or on our days off, we’d pull up random films and
        take turns guessing their IMDb ratings. It became a running game: who could get closest
        without going over?
      </p>

      <p>
        We kept refining it, even during long nights on duty or while camping out during Mardi Gras
        parades. Over time, our little guessing game evolved into something bigger — a shared
        ritual, a mix of movie trivia, intuition, and sibling rivalry.
      </p>

        What you see here is the digital version of that old tradition. CineRate is a love letter to
        those late nights, the inside jokes, and the creative sparks. My brothers and I have made plenty
        of goofy games over the years — one of the more questionable ones involved a game of “Russian
        roulette” with airsoft guns (don’t ask — it probably won’t translate well to the internet).
      </p>

      <p>
        Still, that same mix of humor, tension, and creativity found its way here. CineRate is just
        one of many small worlds my brother and I dreamed up. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as
        we enjoyed inventing it.
